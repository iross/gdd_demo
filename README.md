# GDD Demo

This is a forked repository of https://github.com/jonhusson/gdd_demo. The
primary changes are adding the `find_documents` feature and making it more
notebook-friendly. If you have trouble running a notebook, I suggest utilizing
that repository instead (it should work fine on a totally bare python
installation).

# Running

Assumes that you have jupyter installed. If not, follow the directions at
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html to either install via
Anaconda or via pip

```
jupyter notebook
# then open up the notebook and explore!
```
